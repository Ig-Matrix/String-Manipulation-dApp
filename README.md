## About
<p>
    This decentralized application (dApp) is powered by <a href="https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.3/">Cartesi</a> Rollups technology.
</p>
<p> 
    The dApp allows users to submit strings for text manipulation (e.g., reversing text) while tracking various statistics such as the total number of characters processed, total words, and the longest string received. The benefits of using blockchain technology, such as data integrity, decentralization, and security, are integrated into the system.
